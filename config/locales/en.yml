# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide

    p2_quality: "THE QUALITY OF CARE: El Salvador"
    p2_thanks: "Thank you for participating in the 2020 National Evaluation on the Quality of Care. This effort was carried out as a way to measure the quality of care being provided to boys, girls, and adolescents in residential and non-residential centers throughout El Salvador."
    p2_partnerships: "In partnership with Duke University, CONNA, and ISNA, Whole Child International created a comprehensive tool to measure care under 6 domains: <b>administration and governance; basic needs; child protection; child-caregiver relationships; child experience; and environment</b>. With this report, we hope to provide guidance on ways to improve the quality of care given to children around the country."
    p2_report: "This report contains center-specific scores and recommendations. Our goal is to provide each center with the opportunity to review the areas in which they might already be excelling and which require more attention. We hope this is a useful tool as you consider how to best serve the children under your care."
    p2_interpretation: "Please remember that any low scores should be interpreted as opportunities for improvement and that we will work together to strategize next steps and goals for your center. Also keep in mind that high scores may still require maintenance and we will work with you to help in that area as well."
    p2_appreciation: "Once again, thank you for taking part in the efforts to learn about the quality of care provided to the children in El Salvador. We will be reaching out to you soon to discuss your center's scores in more detail."
    p3_usage: "How to use this report"
    p3_report: "This report will provide you with feedback on areas that your center is already providing good or high-quality care as well as those that may benefit from additional attention."
    p3_overview: 'The “Center Report” page contains an overview of some basic information about your center, including the center’s name, director, person who completed the interview, the date data collection was completed, and whether both elements of this process – the interview and observation – were completed. This page also contains a chart that will allow you to quickly compare your center’s scores to the national averages.'
    p3_feedback: "The report then provides feedback by domain. Each domain and subdomain receives a score of 1 to 7, with scores of 1-3 indicating <b>low quality care</b>, scores of 3.01-5 indicating <b>good care</b>, and scores of 5.01-7 indicating <b>high-quality care</b>. These scores were obtained through a combination of interviews with center leaders and an observation carried out by a trained data collector. You will see your center’s domain-level score, the national average, and a description of the factors that were considered under each domain (which we refer to as subdomains)."
    p3_additional: "You will receive scores for every subdomain and feedback for the area your center is providing the highest level of care. Additionally, centers that had <b>low</b> scores in a subdomain will receive additional feedback on that specific topic. This feedback provides a brief definition of the subdomain, an explanation of its importance, and basic recommendations on how to improve care in this area."
    p3_red_flags: 'This report also provides you with feedback on “red flags” that arose on specific questions that were answered or items that our enumerators observed during their visits that are fundamental to high-quality care. They are flagged here to ensure that your center is aware of any potentially significant issues and to help guide conversations about improvements to your center. These issues should be addressed to the best of your ability to increase the level of care your center is providing. You will see a summary of the question and answer or observation note that triggered a “red flag”. We provide a brief explanation on why a particular “red flag” is important followed by recommendations on ways to address it.'
    p3_note: "Please note that you may not receive red flag feedback under every domain."
    p3_recommendations: "Every center will receive domain-level recommendations based on score. These domain-level recommendations are located in the final section of the report. The recommendations focus primarily on the most important aspects of care. Not all potential methods of improvement are included. Further specific recommendations and strategies to improve care in your center can be discussed in collaboration with your ISNA representative. Feel free to use the checkboxes to mark which points you would like to focus on in your discussions."
    p3_review: "We recommend that you thoroughly review the recommendations below to identify potential areas for improvement. Some recommendations touch on areas that may not be under your immediate control. We encourage you to consult with ISNA, Whole Child, or other organizations, as appropriate, with any questions and to find ways to best support your ongoing efforts to serve the children of El Salvador."

    h_5_3_r: "The Supporting Child Development subdomain measures the extent to which the center assesses and supports growth in the areas of physical growth and movement, language and communication, cognitive ability, and socio-emotional skills. This is important because deficiencies in any of these areas can undermine resilience, compounding any struggles the child might already have adapting to their environment. Centers with high scores in this area tend to be those that assess each child's progress toward achieving developmental milestones and address any concerns by referring to a service provider and adjusting routines or the care environment to support the child. These centers provide regular opportunities for children to practice fine and gross motor skills, cognitive abilities, and socio-emotional skills."

    h_5_4_r: "The Family-like Setting subdomain considers how closely life at the center is to life in households in the surrounding community in terms of culture, norms, and infrastructure. This is important because family-like settings are conducive to providing a child with individualized attention and the opportunity to form a close bond with a caregiver, both of which are essential for their development. Centers with high scores in this area tend to be those that keep sibling groups together regardless of age or gender, prepare and eat meals as a “family”, and create spaces that are typical of what would be seen in the surrounding community. These centers also celebrate cultural traditions that are important to the child and create comfortable spaces for caregivers and children within the home."

Ideally, documentation journals capture the important moments of a child’s life and can help them build a sense of identity and healthy self-esteem. This can be achieved through journaling, scrapbooking, photography, collecting stories or items of significance to the child. Centers with high scores in this area tend to be those that use documentation journals in a collaborative manner, allowing primary caregivers, other staff members, the child, and their friends to include notes or other keepsakes that the child can later take with them after they leave the center."

    h_6_2: "The Materials subdomain measures whether a center is providing children with age- and developmentally-appropriate materials. This is important for children of all ages and, because a child’s needs change over time, centers should strive to provide a variety of materials for each life stage. For younger children, materials should focus on toys, building systems, and crafts that support the development of fine- and gross-motor skills. Older children benefit from sports equipment, books, technology, and age-appropriate furniture. Centers with high scores in this area tend to be those that offer these and other materials that support the healthy development of all children at the center, including materials that meet the needs of children with disabilities, as necessary."
