    p2_quality: "THE QUALITY OF CARE: El Salvador"
    p2_thanks: "Thank you for participating in the 2020 National Evaluation on the Quality of Care. This effort was carried out as a way to measure the quality of care being provided to boys, girls, and adolescents in residential and non-residential centers throughout El Salvador."
    p2_partnerships: "In partnership with Duke University, CONNA, and ISNA, Whole Child International created a comprehensive tool to measure care under 6 domains: <b>administration and governance; basic needs; child protection; child-caregiver relationships; child experience; and environment</b>. With this report, we hope to provide guidance on ways to improve the quality of care given to children around the country."
    p2_report: "This report contains center-specific scores and recommendations. Our goal is to provide each center with the opportunity to review the areas in which they might already be excelling and which require more attention. We hope this is a useful tool as you consider how to best serve the children under your care."
    p2_interpretation: "Please remember that any low scores should be interpreted as opportunities for improvement and that we will work together to strategize next steps and goals for your center. Also keep in mind that high scores may still require maintenance and we will work with you to help in that area as well."
    p2_appreciation: "Once again, thank you for taking part in the efforts to learn about the quality of care provided to the children in El Salvador. We will be reaching out to you soon to discuss your center's scores in more detail."
    p3_usage: "How to use this report"
    p3_report: "This report will provide you with feedback on areas that your center is already providing good or high-quality care as well as those that may benefit from additional attention."
    p3_overview: 'The “Center Report” page contains an overview of some basic information about your center, including the center’s name, director, person who completed the interview, the date data collection was completed, and whether both elements of this process – the interview and observation – were completed. This page also contains a chart that will allow you to quickly compare your center’s scores to the national averages.'
    p3_feedback: "The report then provides feedback by domain. Each domain and subdomain receives a score of 1 to 7, with scores of 1-3 indicating <b>low quality care</b>, scores of 3.01-5 indicating <b>good care</b>, and scores of 5.01-7 indicating <b>high-quality care</b>. These scores were obtained through a combination of interviews with center leaders and an observation carried out by a trained data collector. You will see your center’s domain-level score, the national average, and a description of the factors that were considered under each domain (which we refer to as subdomains)."
    p3_additional: "You will receive scores for every subdomain and feedback for the area your center is providing the highest level of care. Additionally, centers that had <b>low</b> scores in a subdomain will receive additional feedback on that specific topic. This feedback provides a brief definition of the subdomain, an explanation of its importance, and basic recommendations on how to improve care in this area."
    p3_red_flags: 'This report also provides you with feedback on “red flags”. Red flags are notices that there may be some concerns related to the quality of care at your center. They are based on specific answers given or items our enumerators observed during their visits. Their scores are already incorporated into the reports, but they are flagged to ensure that your center is aware of any potentially significant issues and to help guide conversations about improvements to your center. These issues should be addressed to the best of your ability to increase the quality of care your center is providing. You will see a summary of the question and answer or observation note that triggered a red flag. We provide a brief explanation on why a particular red flag is important followed by recommendations on ways to address it. A red flag may be applicable across domains. In that case, the details will only be shown under one domain, but it will be referenced under all that are applicable.'
    p3_note: "Please note that you may not receive red flag feedback under every domain."
    p3_recommendations: "Every center will receive domain-level recommendations based on score. These domain-level recommendations are located in the final section of the report. The recommendations focus primarily on the most important aspects of care. Not all potential methods of improvement are included. Further specific recommendations and strategies to improve care in your center can be discussed in collaboration with your ISNA representative. Feel free to use the checkboxes to mark which points you would like to focus on in your discussions."
    p3_review: "We recommend that you thoroughly review the recommendations below to identify potential areas for improvement. Some recommendations touch on areas that may not be under your immediate control. We encourage you to consult with ISNA, Whole Child, or other organizations, as appropriate, with any questions and to find ways to best support your ongoing efforts to serve the children of El Salvador."

Consider acknowledging and celebrating children’s significant accomplishments, or giving them more freedom to choose free play activities."
    h_5_2_r: "The Individually Assigned Materials subdomain looks at whether children have their own personal belongings and are age-appropriately responsible for keeping track of them. This is important for hygienic reasons and can help meet a child’s individual needs. Allowing them to be responsible for using and storing their own items can help them build self-reliance and basic lifeskills. Centers with high scores in this area tend to provide each child with their own toiletries, clothing, and bedding. Caregivers encourage each child to track and care for their belongings in an age-appropriate manner. Caregivers also ensure that children with disabilities always utilize their own assistive devices."

    aac7: "Make every effort to keep siblings within the same groups, even if there are age differences. In most cases, keeping siblings together is critical for maintaining their close bond and attachment and prevents further trauma as a result of unnecessary separation. Consider making changes to your group structures to allow for siblings to be placed in the same group. If you think this is the result of limited resources (e.g., not enough staff), please speak with ISNA as soon as possible to express an urgent need for more support."

    bcu5_d: "The observer noted that the smell of urine or feces is apparent on all or most of the children."
    r_bcu5: "This is a sign that not enough attention is being paid to the children’s personal hygiene -- whether that means bathing, having their diapers changed, or having their clothes washed periodically. Since it looks like this is a common problem, try to re-evaluate how often these tasks are completed and review whether caregivers are completing them in a timely, proper, and thorough way. Make an effort to change diapers as soon as they are soiled instead of on a predetermined schedule."

    bra1: "For the sake of maintaining a sanitary environment and promoting the comfort and privacy of both children and staff, it is encouraged that center leadership find a way to make a bathroom, toilet, or latrine available. If resources are a challenge, this is the type of project that can often benefit from working with ISNA or NGOs for funding, materials, and labor."

    bra2_d: "The observer noted that bathrooms, toilets, or latrines are unsanitary with evident bodily fluids or feces."
    r_bra2: "Noticeably unsanitary bathrooms, toilets, or latrines are not only a health risk due to the potential for germs and illness, but they can also discourage people from using them. It is important that these areas are kept clean to allow children and staff to use them safely and comfortably. If keeping up with cleaning is a challenge, set up a log to track who has cleaned each area, when it happened, and which tasks were completed."

    cab2_d: "The observer noted that all or most of the children display indiscriminate affection for unknown visitors"
    cab2: "Indiscriminate affection is a strategy children sometimes use to cultivate attention and feel acceptance when they are not securely attached to a primary caregiver. This can be a problem because social boundaries are important to develop safe relationships, and it can be difficult to function in adulthood if children do not learn appropriate social cues and boundaries. If caregivers notice children treating strangers like close friends (running up for hugs, sharing stories or personal treasures, asking for help with a task, etc.) it is important to recognize and discourage this behavior. Caregivers should speak to the child after the stranger has gone, and they should make every effort not to scold or shame the child. To further prevent indiscriminate affection, center visitors should be reminded of how to carry on appropriate interactions with children and how to help them maintain healthy boundaries."

Additionally, caregivers should strive to pay individual attention and show personal affection for each child in their care so the children do not feel such a strong need to seek it elsewhere. If children do show these behaviors, a caregiver should speak to the child after the stranger has gone, and they should make every effort not to scold or shame the child."

    cap2_d: "The interviewee noted that in instances where children come to live in the center without being placed by the government, the center leadership never contact a government authority"
    cap2: "It is important to maintain full transparency with the child protection system. To best support the children under your care, local government authorities must know about who comes to live at the center, even if they only stay for a short period of time. This allows all agencies and organizations involved in child protection to coordinate efforts in the best interest of the child. Work with your local government liaison to establish effective communication strategies to follow when children are placed in your center by unofficial means."

    cap3_d: "The interviewee noted that rather than being placed by the government, children are sometimes dropped off by parents"
    cap3: "Children should only be placed in residential centers by the appropriate government authorities after an investigation has determined that it is in the child’s best interest to remove them from their home. If possible, try to provide or direct parents to supportive services that might help keep children under their care. If that is not possible, contact the most appropriate child protection service agency to report that a child is under your care. This allows all agencies and organizations involved in child protection to coordinate efforts in the best interest of the child."

    cga5_d: "During an observed caregiving activity, no positive communication took place"
    cga5: "Positive communication between children and caregivers helps to build strong relationships and interpersonal skills, while engaging the child in their care. Work with caregivers to ensure they are avoiding using flat, unidirectional, or solely negative communication with the children during caregiving activities. Remember that ideal positive communication calls for a variety of both verbal and nonverbal cues."

    cmc3_d: "The observer noted that there are broken items pose a danger of possible death"
    cmc3: "Items such as toys, furniture, and other materials should be routinely inspected for broken parts that could potentially become severe safety hazards for children (e.g., broken toys could expose dangerous prongs and knife-sharp points or small parts that could easily be choked on). Proactively remove or fix any broken items that could pose serious danger to children."

    csm1: "A child’s case file is a crucial tool that helps care teams understand their history, needs, and circumstances so that high quality individualized care can be provided across caregivers and living situations. If none of the children have files, please work with ISNA to develop them based on existing knowledge of the child."

    csm3_d: "The interviewee noted that none of the children at the center have case meetings"
    csm3: "Case meetings are an important aspect of a child’s complete care package, since the focused attention encourages input and unity from the care team, tracks progress and needs, and helps establish goals for the child. Without case meetings, children’s individual progress and needs can unfortunately be forgotten within the day-to-day routines of the center. Speak to your ISNA representative to learn more about how to set up case meetings for children."

    css1_d: "The interviewee noted that there is no clear process for the children to report any abuse, discrimination, or other concerns in the center"
    css1: "Children must feel capable of sharing information when they experience abuse, discrimination, or other concerns, so that these issues can be immediately addressed. Children also must feel comfortable reporting these issues without the threat of negative consequences. Carefully consider children’s perspectives while you establish and communicate a process that clearly outlines what, when, how, and to whom these issues should be reported."

    css5_b_d: "Interviewee reported safety/security concerns about staff or caregivers"
    css5_b: "Abuse by staff or caregivers is an urgent and serious issue. Ensure that center policies clearly outline appropriate staff behaviors, the documentation process that would take place if any concerns arise, and the procedures that will be used to attend to those concerns. Proactively address this with the staff or caregivers in question, and discuss options for appropriate next steps (corrective action, performance improvement plan, termination) with center leadership. If you suspect that these concerns are related to staff burnout, consider implementing strategies that can increase caregiver well-being."
    css5_c_d: "Interviewee reported safety/security concerns about neglect"
    css5_c: "Neglect is an urgent and serious issue. Center policies should clearly outline the practices that constitute neglect, reporting procedures, the documentation and investigative process that would take place if neglect is suspected, and the course of action that will be used to address those concerns.

    css7_c: "Fires are a common danger, and every child care center needs a fire plan in place. Work with center leadership and local fire officials if needed to define group leaders, mobilization procedures, safe meeting points, and a process to account for all individuals. If possible, consider adding and learning how to properly use smoke detectors and fire extinguishers to assist with fire emergencies."
    css7_h_d: "The interviewee noted that the center has no emergency plan of any kind"
    css7_h: "Emergencies can arise without warning, so every child care center needs emergency plans in place. Earthquakes and fires are the most common, but other types should also be considered (e.g., community violence/gun violence, flooding, or hazardous material spills). For earthquake plans: Work with center leadership to define group leaders, mobilization procedures, safe meeting points, and a process to account for all individuals. For fire plans: Work with center leadership and local fire officials if needed to define group leaders, mobilization procedures, safe meeting points, and a process to account for all individuals. If possible, consider adding and learning how to properly use smoke detectors and fire extinguishers to assist with fire emergencies."

    css10_d: "The interviewee noted that none of the staff are aware of what to do in an emergency"
    css10: "Children’s safety is an integral part of group childcare and necessarily includes being prepared for emergencies and natural disasters. While a clear, written plan is useful and helps prevent poor judgements from being made, caregivers and staff should also undergo education, training, and practice to help them know what to expect and the steps they need to take during disaster events to keep children safe. Caregivers who understand their responsibilities in preparation, protection, response, and recovery activities are better able to provide safe care for children during emergencies and disasters. Consider implementing routine drill exercises for staff to practice the written emergency plan, including communication methods and transportation of children, and to know where emergency and disaster preparedness kits are located and how to use them. If possible, try to conduct these drills when a new staff member is hired so they are also familiar with the plan."

    css11_d: "The interviewee noted that emergency drills are not conducted with the children"
    css11: "While it is the adults’ role to know when to initiate and follow emergency or disaster plans, it is critical that children are also aware of what they must do during emergencies. Preparing children for disasters and emergencies is primarily performed through age-appropriate educational discussions and drills. Consider implementing routine drill exercises with both staff and children to practice the written plan and for children to know the signals and directions they need to follow during emergencies and disasters."

    cta3_d: "The interviewee noted that cases of suspected or witnessed abuse are rarely or never reported to the appropriate authorities."
    cta3: "When people are able to feel comfortable enough sharing sensitive information about suspected or witnessed abuse, it is crucial to protect the children and establish a trustworthy and transparent system by addressing the issues as soon as possible.

    cts2_g_d: "The interviewee noted that none of the listed child documents are available on file"
    cts2_g: "It is very important that the center maintains documentation for the children. For example, a child’s case file is a crucial tool that helps care teams understand their history, needs, and circumstances so that high quality individualized care can be provided across caregivers and living situations. Other documents, including general information (e.g. name, DOB, names of mother/father/family representative, phone numbers), psychosocial assessments, medical records, child development scores, or legal files are also crucial for preserving a complete and consistent record of each child’s history, needs, and circumstances."

    ctu3_d: "The interviewee noted that the center never has clean drinking water"
    ctu3: "Clean drinking water is vital to a child’s healthy development and should always be readily available to the children. If your center is low on resources, consider using inexpensive strategies such as boiling water to make water safe to drink. If your center is not able to use those methods, please contact ISNA to help you find alternatives that can allow your center to meet this need."

    dca2_d: "The observer noted that diaper changing areas are unsanitary with evident health concerns"
    dca2: "Noticeably unsanitary diaper changing areas are not only a health risk due to the potential for germs and illness, but they can also discourage caregivers from using them. It is important that these areas are kept clean to allow caregivers to hygienically change children into clean diapers. If keeping up with cleaning is a challenge, set up a log to track who has cleaned each area, when it happened, and which tasks were completed."

    els5_c_d: "The interviewee noted that a few of the children ages 7-16 years attend basic education"
    els5_c: "School attendance is required by law for most of the children in this age group, and basic education provides proven benefits to lifetime health, wellbeing, employment, and financial status. Discuss each child’s particular situation and reasons for not attending school with the child and center leadership, and develop a plan to improve the child’s school attendance. Where required by law, ensure that children are attending school. When appropriate, consider using alternative modes of education, including remote learning, adult education, vocational training programs, and other educational opportunities that will enhance their ability to gain independence after they leave the center."

Encourage these children to use alternative modes of education, including remote learning, adult education, vocational training programs, and other educational opportunities that will enhance their ability to gain independence after they leave the center."

    els7_d_d: "The interviewee noted that school-aged children are not attending school because they exhibit extremely challenging behaviors that the school cannot manage."
    r_els7_d: "Behavioral issues should not prevent or deny a child the opportunity to attend school. Include the center’s technical staff and educators in the creation of an individualized plan that can address these challenging behaviors and coordinate these efforts with the school. If no available school can manage the behavior, involve the expertise of a social worker or counselor to find other options or work on improving the behavior. Additionally, use alternative modes of education, such as remote learning, as necessary."
    n_els7_d: "Behavioral issues should not prevent or deny a child the opportunity to attend school.

    els7_e_d: "The interviewee noted that school-aged children are not attending school because they are looking after other children."
    r_els7_e: "If children are needed to take care of other children in the center, this is a sign that more caregivers are needed. This is a case where an urgent request should be submitted to ISNA to help increase the number of staff or to provide other forms of support."
    n_els7_e: "Knowing that it can be difficult for families to provide care for all children, it is strongly encouraged that they explore all options that might allow school-aged children to continue their studies. Encourage families to enroll their school-aged children in educational programs that can best meet their needs."
    els7_f_d: "The interviewee noted that school-aged children are not attending school because they refuse to attend school."

    eta2: "Noticeably unsanitary eating areas are not only a health risk due to the potential for germs and illness, but they can also discourage children and staff from using them. It is important that these areas are kept clean to allow children and staff to have a space where they can safely and comfortably eat. If keeping up with cleaning is a challenge, set up a log to track who has cleaned each area, when it happened, and which tasks were completed."

    fom3_d: "The observer noted that children are always confined in cribs or other sleeping apparatuses"
    fom3: "The ability to move freely is vital to a child’s development. If children are frequently confined to spaces that restrict their movement, they are at risk of underdeveloping their muscles, which can have a negative impact on their body awareness, self-regulation, posture, and coordination. Freedom of movement also allows children to develop a healthy sense of independence as they learn to navigate the world around them. As much as possible, find ways to prevent children from being confined and create spaces where children can move and play safely."

    fom8_a: "No child should be physically restrained, except in extreme situations where someone’s physical safety is in question. Restraint can lead to physical injury and psychological trauma and can also impact proper development. Please work with your technical advisor to find alternative strategies that can effectively minimize or eliminate the use of physical restraints, including de-escalation techniques."

    fpa3_d: "The observer noted that the food preparation area is unsanitary"
    fpa3: "Noticeably unsanitary food preparation areas are not only a health risk due to the potential for germs and illness, but they can also discourage caregivers from using them. It is important that these areas are kept clean to allow caregivers to prepare safe meals while remaining safe themselves. If keeping up with cleaning is a challenge, set up a log to track who has cleaned each area, when it happened, and which tasks were completed."

    fpa4_d: "The observer noted that there is not adequate space and resources for hygienic food storage"
    fpa4: "Healthy food depends not only on quantity and nutritional value, but also safety. If food is improperly stored (accessible to animals, not refrigerated when needed, kept for so long that it rots or accumulates mold), it can pose health risks. Depending on the types of food that you keep at the center, look into ways to improve practices for properly sealing, refrigerating, dating, and finding safe places for food storage."

    hlt1_d: "The interviewee noted that children do not have access to medical care"
    hlt1: "The 1946 Constitution of the World Health Organization describes “…the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being.” Children living in residential centers are no different, and every effort should be made to ensure that they can access medical care. Please remember that access to urgent medical care and regular check-ups are both critical parts of ensuring both the short- and long-term health of the children. If there are really no local resources available, please talk to your ISNA representative and look into whether any NGOs can connect the center to services."

    hlt7_d: "The interviewee noted that none of the staff receive basic first aid training"
    hlt7: "Children can be accident prone and often require immediate care for a range of potential injuries. Training staff on situations ranging from scrapes, cuts, and burns to broken bones and choking can ensure proper attention is given, prevent further complications, and even save lives."

    hlt9_d: "The interviewee noted that there is no first aid kit at the center"
    hlt9: "No matter the injury, from minor to more serious ailments, a first aid kit is crucial for reducing the severity of the injury and preventing infection. They play an important role in reducing severity of injuries and enabling faster treatment of injuries, which can be both life- and cost-saving. Consider acquiring a first aid kit as soon as possible and storing it in an easily accessible place."

    hlt10_d: "The interviewee noted that there is no plan to get children proper care in case of a medical emergency"
    hlt10: "Access to emergency health care is especially important for children. Creating a plan in advance can save critically important time, which often helps ensure proper treatment and recovery after they reach care. When developing a plan, consider who will go with the child, where the proper medical care is located, when it is an appropriate situation to call for emergency care, and how the child will get there. Don’t forget to share this plan with all staff. If there are no resources available, please talk to your ISNA representative and look into whether any NGOs can connect the center to emergency medical services."

    ide5_d: "The observer noted that there are no self-care items"
    ide5: "Items like toothbrushes, towels, soap, hairbrushes, and other personal hygiene products should be available to the children in the center. Many of these items are needed throughout the day and should always be in stock. If the lack of resources prevents your center from being able to provide these products, please talk to your ISNA representative or check with NGOs to see if they can help secure supplies."

    ide8_d: "The interviewee noted that feminine products are never available in the center"
    ide8: "For most children, menstruation begins at age 12, but some can begin several years earlier. It is important that they have access to feminine products at all times, as periods can come unexpectedly. Ensure that feminine products are always in stock and in a location where children can access them as needed without having to ask for them. If the lack of resources prevents your center from being able to provide these products, please talk to your ISNA representative or check with NGOs to see if they can help secure supplies."

    ide15_d: "The observer noted that older children are performing caregiving activities to the point that their own needs are not being met"
    r_ide15: "Although older children can be encouraged to contribute to the group by performing basic chores, they should not be responsible for the care of younger children, especially if their own needs are not being met. This may look like not completing schoolwork or not getting enough rest because of caregiving duties. If older children are not able to address their own needs, it may be a sign that more staff is required to fully support the center. Bring this to your ISNA representative’s attention so they can assist with finding more resources."
    n_ide15: "Although older children can be encouraged to contribute to the group by performing basic chores, they should not be responsible for the care of younger children to the point that their own needs are not being met.

Bring this to your ISNA representative’s attention so they can assist with finding more resources."

    ide18_d: "The observer noted that there is no toilet that children can use whenever they need"
    r_ide18: "Sanitation has been declared a basic human right by the United Nations. Having an accessible toilet helps children meet their basic needs and is essential to their ability to manage bodily functions, including urination, defecation, and menstruation. Take care to ensure that toilets are not locked when not in use and that children can use them freely."

    idp1_d: "The observer noted that there is no water accessible for hand washing"
    idp1: "To promote good health and hygiene, it is important that children are able to access water for proper hand washing. Hand washing (with water and soap) is an easy, inexpensive, and effective way to prevent the spread of germs and keep kids and adults healthy."

    ltc12_f_d: "The interviewee noted that at least one child left the center in the last 12 months to be moved to another center."
    ltc12_f: "Though this can happen for many possible reasons and exceptions do exist, transfers between centers are generally discouraged, especially when children are transferred because of challenging behavior. Continuity and consistency are crucial for children in institutional settings, and transfers that suddenly and unnecessarily force children into a new setting tend to be detrimental. Coordinate with case management teams and the proper authorities to prevent the need for unnecessary transfers, and exhaust all other options before considering a transfer to another center."
    ltc12_g_d: "The interviewee noted that at least one child died at the center in the last 12 months."
    ltc12_g: "Thinking about the circumstances of the death(s), consider whether it was preventable and/or could have been related to their care at the center. If there are any aspects of care at the center that could have played a role, urgently review these issues with center leadership and your technical advisor in order to implement appropriate corrections."

    nut2_d: "The interviewee noted that the center struggled to obtain and provide enough food to meet the needs of the children at least one day in the last 12 months."
    r_nut2: "Food security is a basic need for all children, and periods of hunger can lead to malnutrition, impacting both physical and cognitive development. Additionally, food insecurity can cause high levels of stress, making it difficult for children to regulate their emotions and behavior. If the center’s struggles were purely related to resources, make sure you have clearly communicated the urgency of these shortfalls to the proper authorities. If bureaucracy or availability were the issue, consider opening dialogue with government officials or political representatives to improve the situation."

    nut10_d: "The interviewee noted that children do not receive snack"
    r_nut10: "Providing children well-rounded meals is key to their growth and nutrition. Healthy, well-timed snacks can provide important nutrients to children between meals, helping them maintain their energy and satisfy hunger. Snacks can include a serving of fruit and vegetables, crackers and cheese, and other small and healthy portions of food. They should be relatively easy to put together and distribute. If the center’s struggles are purely related to resources, make sure you have clearly communicated the urgency of these shortfalls to the proper authorities."

    ogh1_d: "The observer noted that all or most of the children have observable injuries or illnesses"
    ogh1: "While injury and illness are unavoidable in childhood, these should be prevented to the extent possible. Please work with the caregivers and staff to ensure that children are properly supervised, and that the center’s environment is safe and supports good hygiene and cleanliness."

    ogh2_d: "The observer noted that none of the injured or ill children are properly attended to"
    ogh2: "Untreated injuries and illnesses run the risk of becoming more serious over time and can eventually pose as life-threatening dangers. Please work with the caregivers and staff to attend to every child with an observable injury or illness immediately."

    rbi7_d_d: "Interviewee responds that the following strategies are utilized in response to children’s common challenging behaviors: withdrawal of affection"
    r_rbi7_d: "Intentional withdrawal of affection can be a common discipline technique, where a caregiver sets down, turns away from, or ignores a child who has broken a rule or caused offense. This can be especially common with very young children who might not yet fully understand verbal communication. While this strategy may seem effective in a typical home with typically-developing children, it is especially harmful for children with abandonment or trauma histories. It is important to use every opportunity to teach these children that they are valuable and that their caregivers are trustworthy. Please work with caregivers to find alternative strategies, including positive discipline or redirection, that can effectively address behavior issues without causing additional harm."

    r_rbi7_k: "While physical discipline is officially prohibited, it is important to recognize when it happens. It is also important to know that it can cause injury, long-lasting trauma, and other damaging emotional effects, and that there are more constructive ways to correct children’s behavior.

    rbi10_d: "The interviewee noted that when physical discipline is used, it is intended to cause pain"
    rbi10: "Physical discipline should never be used to intentionally injure or wound a child or to cause pain. Caregivers should strive to address all discipline issues when they are calm rather than angry. Work with caregivers to develop a behavior modification system that rewards desired behaviors and penalizes undesired behaviors predictably. In most cases this will eliminate the necessity for caregivers to come up with appropriate discipline strategies in the moment. Additionally, ensure that caregivers are empowered to take breaks or ask for help when they are feeling undue stress or experiencing burnout"

    r_rbo4_e: "No children should be physically restrained, except in extreme situations where someone’s physical safety is in question. Restraint can lead to physical injury and psychological trauma and can impact development. Please work with your technical advisor to find alternative strategies that can effectively address situations you may have encountered."

    r_rbo4_g: "Children should not be confined, except in extreme situations where someone’s physical safety is in question. This strategy should be avoided, as it is especially harmful for children with abandonment or trauma histories.

    rbo4_k_d: "Interviewee responded that the following strategies are utilized in response to children who demonstrate extremely challenging behaviors: any type of physical discipline"
    r_rbo4_k: "While physical discipline is officially prohibited, it is important to recognize when it happens. It is also important to know that it can cause injury, long-lasting trauma, and other damaging emotional effects, and that there are more constructive ways to correct children’s behavior. Now is the time to address physical discipline in the center, whether it was a one-time occurrence, one repeat offender, or a common occurrence. It is important to use every opportunity to teach children that they are valuable and that their caregivers are not there to hurt them. Please work with caregivers and any available resources (social workers, counselors, therapists, ISNA representatives, etc.) to find alternative strategies that can effectively address behavior issues without causing additional harm."

    rbo6_d: "The observer saw physical intimidation take place"
    rbo6: "Physical intimidation, even if no physical contact is made, makes unfair use of strength, posturing, and power dynamics, and can cause serious emotional damage. It is important to use every opportunity to teach children that they are valuable, that their caregivers are trustworthy, and that they will keep them safe. Please work with caregivers to find more constructive alternative strategies that can effectively address behavior issues without causing additional harm. Please also make sure that children are protected from any intimidation from other children. If there are children intimidating caregivers, please refer to recommendations and guidance about managing challenging behaviors."

    rcd9_d: "The interviewee noted that children with disabilities are restrained punitively, for discipline, and/or for convenience"
    rcd9: "No child should be physically restrained, except in extreme situations where someone’s physical safety is in question. Restraint can lead to physical injury and psychological trauma and can impact development. For children with disabilities, restraints can present even greater risk to their wellbeing. Please work with your technical advisor to find alternative strategies that can effectively address situations you may have encountered."

    sap1_d: "The observer noted that the center has no security"
    sap1: "A lack of security precautions leaves children and staff vulnerable to internal and external safety concerns. Taking even basic precautions can help protect the center from potentially dangerous aspects of the community. Work with staff and your ISNA representative to identify the most pressing concerns and develop a plan to implement security measures."

    sdm1_a_d: "The interviewee noted that the center has no caregiving staff (e.g., caregivers, physical therapists, nurses)"
    r_sdm1_a: "Continuity of care is important for children to develop healthy, secure attachments to a primary caregiver. When no one is explicitly responsible for caring for a child, the child is unlikely to develop a meaningful relationship with a primary caregiver necessary for their healthy development. Explore ways to change your staffing structure so that children have at least one primary caregiver who can meet their needs."

    sdm6_d: "The interviewee noted that in the last 12 months, more than 25% of staff have left the center"
    sdm6: "If you experience high volumes of staff turnover at your center, it may be a sign of burnout. Additionally, this high turnover of staff and possible primary caregivers in a child’s life can detrimentally affect the child’s attachments and healthy development. Please work immediately with ISNA to develop strategies and solutions to address high staff turnover at your center."

    sia8_d: "The observer noted that none of the children with disabilities have their needs met"
    sia8: "Children with disabilities often present special or unique types of needs to caregiving staff, but these should not be ignored or assigned a lower priority. Work with each of these children and any assigned social workers, physical therapists, or counselors to re-focus on these children’s care plans. Talk openly with your ISNA representative if there are special needs that the center feels it cannot meet due to budget, personnel, or other limitations."

    sla6_d_d: "The observer noted that the sleeping area is unsanitary."
    sla6_d: "Healthy sleep is critical to children’s development making it important to maintain a sanitary sleeping area. Work with staff to keep this area cleaner from dirt, dust, mold, and other messes or smells. If keeping up with cleaning is a challenge, set up a log to track who has cleaned each area, when it happened, and which tasks were completed."

    sot3_d: "The interviewee noted that staff have received no training in the last 12 months"
    sot3: "Continuing training and education helps ensure that staff are up-to-date on important methods that have been shown to increase safety or better care for children. All staff, particularly caregivers, should receive training throughout the year. Connect with your ISNA representative to receive the schedules for the trainings they or other organizations offer. If scheduling is an issue, consider rotating caregivers or bringing in substitute caregivers to help, or hold trainings during regularly scheduled staff meetings."

    sts2_d: "The interviewee noted that the center typically closes for national holidays (due to staffing issues)"
    sts2: "Children and their families often rely on a center’s support for their daily activities, including during holidays. Staff schedules should be set up in a way that supports continuity and builds relationships between children and caregivers. Consider implementing a rotating shift schedule to prevent the center from closing during holidays or other major events, which will help maintain continuity of care for children."

    sts3_d: "The interviewee noted that the center typically closes when staff are unable to work their shift"
    sts3: "Staff schedules should be set up in a way that supports continuity and builds relationships between children and caregivers. Consider building a base of regular substitutes who can come in when staff are unable to work their shift."

    vin6_c_d: "The observer was supervised by a staff member for only a small portion of the observation period"
    vin6_c: "As a safety precaution, visitors that enter the center should be accompanied by at least one staff member at all times, particularly when children are present. The staff member does not need to be someone from the center leadership team, nor does it need to be the same person throughout the entire visit. However, at least one staff member should supervise visitors during their stay, even if they are known or returning visitors. If possible, assign this role to specific members of your staff. Be sure to update your visitor policy to let visitors know they will be accompanied during their stay."

    r_vis2_1_g: "Tourist visits to residential care centers, despite best intentions, can cause more harm than good. An entire industry has grown out of thousands of tourist visits (known as orphanage tourism), and it allows children to be highly susceptible to abuse and exploitation. To ensure the safety, protection, and privacy rights of children at the center, do not allow tourists to visit the children at the center. If possible, consider meeting with tourists away from the children’s homes for advocacy, outreach, or donor support."

    vnc3_k_d: "The observer noted that no positive communication took place during the observation period"
    vnc3_k: "Positive communication between children and caregivers helps to build strong relationships and interpersonal skills, while engaging the child in their care. Work with caregivers to ensure they are avoiding using flat, unidirectional, or solely negative communication with the children. Remember that ideal positive communication calls for a variety of both verbal and nonverbal cues."

    vol6_c_d: "The interviewee noted that few of the volunteers go through a verification process before working at the center"
    vol6_c: "To ensure the safety of the children and staff at the center, all volunteers should undergo a screening process before working in the center. The screening process can help verify the potential volunteer’s identity, and bring to light any worrying personal histories, enabling center leadership to better protect the children in their care. These processes are conducted by outside organizations and are the responsibility of the volunteer, meaning the center only needs to conduct a basic review of documentation. Consider implementing verification processes for volunteers who wish to work at your center."
